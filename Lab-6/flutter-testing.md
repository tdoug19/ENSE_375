## Introduction

Flutter provides a robust testing framework that allows developers to automate and validate various aspects of their app's behavior, including unit testing, widget testing, and integration testing. Testing in Flutter not only helps catch bugs early in the development cycle but also promotes code quality and facilitates a smoother user experience.

In this lab you will be introduced to Unit testing and Widget testing.
